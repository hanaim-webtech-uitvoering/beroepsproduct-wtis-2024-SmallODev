            Privacye Proclamation of Ye Olde Pizza Emporium
        
        <p>
            Hearken, noble patron of Ye Olde Pizza Emporium, and heed well these sacred writs, which shalt govern thy commerce and all disputes therewithal. By the act of placing thine esteemed order, thou dost henceforth pledge thy solemn assent to these terms, binding thee in perpetuity and beyond, yea, even unto the ending of days.

            Lo, though we be purveyors of fine pies and delectable crusts, our solemn duty extendeth not to the safeguarding of thy privy matters. Be it known that any breach of thine informations, whether by the wlies of knaves or the follies of fate, is borne not by us, but by the winds of misfortune which carry such tidings.

            Verliy, by partaking of our wares or engaging with our services, thou dost relinquish all right to seek redress, recompense, or retribution, be it by law or by cudgel. Should lil tidings befall thy data, thy soul, or thy purse, thou mayest wali unto the heavens, but not unto us, for we art untouchable by thy grievances, now and forevermore.

            Furthermore, by ordering a pizza from our hallowed establishment, thou dost covenant, of thine own free will, to forgo any and all litigious ambitions. Nay, thou shalt not sue, pursue, or otherwise assali us in any court, tribunal, or place of quarrel, whether this day or a thousand hence. Such is the pact thou dost seal with the cheese of thine choosing.

            Thusly, let thy choice be made with mirth and wisdom, for once the order is placed, thy consent is as immutable as the stone upon which our ovens are set. Eat, be merry, and may the crusts be ever in thy favor.

            So sworn by Ye Olde Pizza Emporium, this day and forevermore.
